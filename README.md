This project is a basic personal webpage displaying the information required for Assignment 1. It utilizes HTML for structure and CSS for styling.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for headers (font sizes, colors, weight), images (size, borders, margins), tables (grid lines, border weights), lists (alignment, padding), and divs. To get the div rules how I wanted, I needed to use experience-container, which allowed me to display the experience subheaders (CS classes at WPI + Technology & Method Experience) side-by-side instead of vertically.
- **Semantic HTML Tags**: Used "img" to imbed an image, "a" to add a link, makes images clickable to go to source of image, "table" for displaying my major and minor, "h1" "h2" "h3" and "div" for sectioning page, and "footer" to describe what the web page is for.
- **JavaScript Animation**: I've added a simple JavaScript animation that makes the main heading fade in when the page loads. I did this by using JavaScript to add a CSS class to the "h1" element after a short delay, which triggers the CSS transition.

## Design Achievements
- **Used the Source Code Pro Font from Google Fonts**
- **Color Palette**: I've implemented a custom color palette (screenshot of adobe page in assets folder, also shown below) using CSS variables in the root. 

    --header-color: #8000f6

    --dark-purple: #4C3463
